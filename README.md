# MyReads Project

This project implements the MyReads per Udacity rubric.
Functionality includes a default page that shows books by shelf. Books can be moved from shelf to shelf.

Also included is a search page, with full history, i.e. back button works. Books can be searched for (within the limits of the provided BookAPI). Searched books are displayed and can be assigned to shelves. Books that are already assigned to shelves are shown as such on the selector. When a book is shelved, it's selector immediately shows the updated shelf on the search results page.

No new CSS was developed or UI changed from starting template.
